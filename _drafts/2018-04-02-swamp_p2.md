I tried to solve different task, and I was not so successful. This write-up is complete
from the point of view of the solution... but I didn't managed to get the flag.

**So why am I posting it?**

Because I think this is worth sharing. Be patient and keep reading ;-)

# The task
The challenge is accessible via a zip folder. The password of that zip is the flag
of a previous challenge. The main contents of the folder are the following files:
* a lore for the challenge;
* `examples.p`: a pickle file containing, for each row a tuple of five floats and a couple of int;
* `page_of_numbers.p`: a pickle file containing, for each row a tuple of five floats.

Mmmh. What the hell?
Let's read the lore. Be careful in reading this... *because this lore matters*.
You'll understand why at the bottom of this write-up.

```
THE LORE
```

Basically, each tuple corresponds to a bullet! I have the (x,y) position of the shooting, the speed of shooting,
the angle above the horizontal and direction from shooting position.
It's simple 3D physics: I need to calculate the trajectory of the bullet and it's impact point.

# The physics behind this challenge
I'm going to refer to **(x,y)** for the position, **v** for speed, **theta** for angle above the horizontal and **gamma** for the direction.
