My name is **Luca Demetrio**, PhD student at [DIBRIS - University of Genova](https://www.dibris.unige.it/) and amateur [Tap Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance) &  [Hip Hop dancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop).
I feel deeply chained to science and art, leading my mind to perceive the world in an unusual way.
