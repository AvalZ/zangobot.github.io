My name is **Luca Demetrio**, PhD student at <span style="color: blue">[DIBRIS - University of Genova](https://www.dibris.unige.it/)</span> and amateur  <span style="color: blue">[Tap Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance)</span> &  <span style="color: blue">[Hip Hop dancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop)</span>.
I feel deeply chained to science and art, leading my mind to perceive the world in an unusual way.
